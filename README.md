# AnitamaSaver

Anitama is one of the professional ACG criticism websites in China. Recently, we were regreted to hear that the website will stop operations for some reasons, and it will be closed therefore we cannot visit the articles any more. In order to store the articles, the knowledge and thoughts for both authors and prudent readers, we build AnitamaSaver, a temporal project to save all the historical articles automatically.

## Roadmap

* [*] Save the article metadatas from channel page as json (Title, subtitle, author, categories)
* [ ] Save each article raw-html-data as json
* [ ] Save the media data (mainly images) for each article and maintain the image-article mapping
* [ ] Parse the raw html article data for better represent rendering
